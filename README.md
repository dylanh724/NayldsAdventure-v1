# NalydsAdventure-v1
Although this is old code (2012) before we even got into OOP, this game scored top-ranking in my class as a final project for our first semester of VB.NET in college.  The game even had dynamic encounters where it wasn't the same every time. 

Ignore the architecture, as it was early college, but I display this as a simple example of what I can do in a very short period of time from never using .NET before in my life to this game in a few months time. Made within 1 week (forgive the ugly interface):
